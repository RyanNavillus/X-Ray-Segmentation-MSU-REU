3. Ryan will find/develop mask drawing tool in python

4. Will try semantic segmentation with UNET.

Discussed progress on different detection+segmentation+classification scenarios

1. Ryan's plan will be to focus on a whole image classifier for line present vs line absent
will use data from stanford chest and potentially our ped's data
can use Carina's resnet code as a starting place.

2. After success with classification, will look at using labelbox on standford data

3. Hopefully Jonathan B will have Osemis working for fast shared labeling (then we will recruit others in lab to label!)

--> MID-SURE abstract will focus on whole image classification line +/-

1. Learning about tubes/lines

2. Going to try Res+NET + U+NET segmenter after initial res-net classification of line present

3.  As time allows, start thinking about SIIM Pneumothorax Challenge.  Will discuss week of July 8.  

4. Try to set up shadow of radiologist.  Meet with radiologist.
